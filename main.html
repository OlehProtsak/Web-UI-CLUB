                    <h1>Information about Club:</h1>
                    <p>Associazione Calcio Milan, commonly
                        referred to as AC Milan or simply Milan, is a professional football club in Milan, Italy,
                        founded in 1899. The club has spent its entire history, with the exception of the 1980–81
                        and 1982–83 seasons, in the top flight of Italian football, known as Serie A since 1929–30.

                        AC Milan's 18 FIFA and UEFA trophies is the fourth highest out of any club (joint with Boca
                        Juniors), and the most out of any Italian club. Milan has won a joint record three
                        Intercontinental Cups and one FIFA Club World Cup,seven European Cup/Champions League titles
                        (Italian record), the UEFA Super Cup a joint record five times and the Cup Winners' Cup
                        twice. With 18 league titles, Milan is the third most successful club in Serie A, behind
                        local rivals Inter Milan (19 league titles) and Juventus (36 league titles). They have also
                        won the Coppa Italia five times, and the Supercoppa Italiana seven.

                        Milan's home games are played at San Siro, also known as the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza. The
                        stadium, which is shared with city rivals Internazionale, is the largest in Italian football,
                        with a total capacity of 75,923. They have a long-standing rivalry with Inter, with whom
                        they contest the Derby della Madonnina; it is one of the most followed derbies in football.

                        The club is one of the wealthiest in Italian and world football. It was a founding member of
                        the now-defunct G-14 group of Europe's leading football clubs as well as its replacement, the
                        European Club Association.</p>
